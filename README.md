# rust-auth

A full-stack secure and performant authentication system using rust's [Actix web][1] and JavaScript's [SvelteKit][2].

This application resulted from [this series of articles][3] and it's currently live [here][4](I have disabled the backend from running live).

## Run locally

You can run the application locally by first cloning it:

```bash
~/$ git clone https://github.com/Sirneij/rust-auth.git
```

After that, change directory into each subdirectory: `backend` and `frontend` in different terminals. Then following the instructions in each subdirectory to run them.
